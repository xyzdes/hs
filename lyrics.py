Dear Ms. Elizabeth Franklin,

Let's suppose I have a rope, and this rope rope rope
begins by being manila rope, then it goes on by being
cotton rope, then it goes on with being nylon, then it
goes on with being silk. So I tie a knot in the rope,
and I move the knot down along the rope. Now, is it-as
it moves along-the same knot or a different knot? We
would say it is the same because you recognize the
pattern of the knot. But at one point it's manila, at
another point it's cotton, another point it's nylon,
and another it's silk. And that's just like us.

Yours trully,
Obi One Kanobe
General Manager of the Jedi Order

So then, the physical world: we can't even find any
stuff out of which it's made. We can only recognize
each other, and I say "Well, I realize that I met you
before, and that I see you again. But the thing that I
recognize is not anything, really, except a consistent
pattern." Let's suppose I have a rope, and this rope
begins by being manila rope, then it goes on by being
cotton rope, then it goes on with being nylon, then it
goes on with being silk. So I tie a knot in the rope,
and I move the knot down along the rope. Now, is it-as

would say it is the same because you recognize the
pattern of the knot. But at one point it's manila, at
another point it's cotton, another point it's nylon,
and another it's silk. And that's just like us. We are
recognized by the fact that, one day, you face the same
way as you did the day before,and people recognize your
facing. So they say that's John Doe or Mary Smith. But,
actually, the contents of your face-whatever they may be;"""

Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 911, please call the doctor
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody want a piece, we gon' split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You 'bout to catch a cold, stay the fuck from 'round me
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout "what kinda shits he on?"
You'll disappear like "poof, bitch be gone"
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain in the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?"""
all_star = """Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold"""

downtown = """Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home-bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home-bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight"""

You know the rules and so do I

Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
